One promising approach for detecting these pathological lesions involves the use of fluorescent ligands, which are molecules capable of binding to AD-related lesions and emitting detectable light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These ligands can be further converted into positron emission tomography (PET) tracers by labeling one of the atoms within the ligand, thereby enabling real-time monitoring of AD pathogenesis.\cite{Nordeman2016} The selection of appropriate fluorescent ligands is critical, as they must possess specific characteristics to effectively detect AD-related lesions.\cite{Nunez-Diaz2024Jan} First and foremost, these ligands should have the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to ensure they can reach the target areas within the brain. Additionally, they should exhibit environmental sensitivity, meaning their optophysical properties change in response to different environments. Their sensitivity enables them to exhibit distinct spectra in different environments, such as in water or within proteins. These spectral changes can be attributed to both molecular and electronic structural alterations. 

To understand the microscopic interactions between ligands and amyloid fibrils, and to uncover the dynamic behavior, binding modes, and energy landscapes of these complexes, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a pivotal role. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of optical ligands. Moreover, conducting comparative studies among multiple ligands can provide insights into the factors that drive binding to fibrils. Understanding specific binding sites is also advantageous, as it enables the design of ligands that bind selectively to chosen sites while avoiding others. For instance, a new generation of ligands could be designed to avoid the binding sites common to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ligand [18F]AV-1451, which has been shown to bind off-target and produce misleading signals.\cite{Vermeiren2018}

Above is the two para from manuscript. how do i connect the two pararagraphs. I was thinking of connecting using "molecular structural change" like by evaluating dihedral distribution in different environments.
