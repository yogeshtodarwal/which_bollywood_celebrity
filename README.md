A streamlit web app which can tell with which bollywood celebrity your face resembles

The "Which Bollywood Celebrity Are You?" web application is an engaging and innovative project that leverages the power of deep learning to match users' faces with Bollywood celebrities. Built on the Streamlit framework, which is renowned for its ease of use and efficiency in building data applications, this project uses the VGG-Face model, a cutting-edge facial recognition technology.

The core of this application is the VGG-Face model, a variant of the VGG-16 model specifically trained on a large dataset of celebrity faces. This allows the application to analyze the unique facial features of the user, compare them with its database of Bollywood celebrities, and find the closest match. The process involves the user uploading a photo of themselves, after which the application processes the image, extracts facial features, and runs a similarity comparison against its celebrity database.

This project is not just a fun tool for Bollywood fans to see which celebrity they resemble the most but also serves as an excellent learning project for those interested in machine learning, computer vision, and web development. It showcases the practical application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for facial recognition tasks and provides hands-on experience with Streamlit, an essential tool for deploying machine learning models in interactive web applications.

By recreating this project, gained insights into the complexities of facial recognition technologies, understand the workings of deep learning models like VGG-Face, and explore the intricacies of building and deploying web applications with Streamlit.
