Dear Professor Kaila,

My research interest lies in the development of theoretical models and computational techniques for understanding chemical systems at the molecular level. During my doctoral studies under Professor Patrick Norman at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, I focused on force field parametrization and computational prediction of protein–ligand interactions relevant to neurodegenerative diseases. This provided me with extensive expertise in molecular simulations and modeling of biochemical systems.

In addition to my doctoral work, I have gained significant experience in machine learning (ML) methods through research projects during my integrated master's at IIT Bombay (India) and an internship at Radboud University (Netherlands). I was particularly fascinated by generative adversarial networks and their applications in chemistry and biology. I have direct experience applying ML to map molecular data to chemical properties, skills that will be invaluable for this postdoctoral position.


Throughout my training, I have sought out opportunities to collaborate across disciplines. As a PhD student, I worked with diverse theoretical and experimental research groups on a range of chemistry projects. The proposed postdoc excites me because it presents the prospect to work at the dynamic interface of computational biochemistry, machine learning, and experimental biophysics under your mentorship in collaboration with Dr. Simon Olsson's lab. 

This unique interdisciplinary project aligns perfectly with my expertise in molecular simulations and machine learning, while also allowing me to expand my horizon into the area of cellular energy metabolism. I am confident that my current competencies will enable me to make significant contributions to our understanding of how membrane protein structures and mutations impact their function in capturing cellular energy.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hopefully discussing my application further.

Sincerely,
Yogesh Todarwal
