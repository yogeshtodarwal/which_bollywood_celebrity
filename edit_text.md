Experimental results align with the calculated relative binding energies of the ligands, with pFTAA and bTVBT4 displaying fluorescence upon binding to tau fibrils, whereas HS-276 having the lowest binding energy does not. However, the difference in binding energy between bTVBT4 (which fluoresces) and HS-276 (which does not) is only 0.8 kcal/mol, falling within the error range of the PMF method used to calculate free energy. The ambiguous fluorescence behavior of qFTAA-CN observed in some experiments might be attributed to post-translational modifications of tau, specifically the acetylation of LYS369 at site S3, which could weaken its binding to tau and inhibit fluorescence.\cite{Alquezar2021Jan} Further investigation is required to confirm this hypothesis and to explore whether pFTAA can bind to site S3 even after post-translational modifications, especially given its higher binding energy compared to qFTAA-CN.




In the analysis of ligand distribution surrounding the tau protofilament, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:Density plot}(b), a distinct pattern emerges. Unlike the A$\beta$(1––42) case, here,  HS-276 is characterized by a lower population density around the tau protofilament, whereas pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, and bTVBT4 exhibit a comparatively high density. This difference in density likely stems from the differential affinity of HS-276 towards the tau fibrils.







-------------------

Intriguingly, the protein environment induced significant alterations in the conformer patterns of all four ligands when compared to their behavior in water. (For neutral ligand all conformers are populated, while for anionic and neutrationic ligands significant change in pattern is observed )

Complementing these binding site observations,  the interaction energies given in Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies} show that the binding of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN to the tau fibril is driven by Coulomb interactions, while the binding of HS-276 and bTVBT4 is driven by LJ interactions. 

All ligands bind to their respective sites parallel to the A$\beta$(1––42) fibril axis. The binding sites S1 and S3 have been previously reported in the literature for other ligands.\cite{Murugan2018Jul} However, we did not find any mention of site S2 in the existing literature, where the HS-276 ligand binds. 

 Their binding to the A$\beta$(1––42) protein is driven by Coulombic interactions, as seen in Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies}.

 The binding of the neutral ligand HS-276 and cationic bTVBT4 to the A$\beta$(1––42) protein is mainly driven by LJ interactions (see Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies}).
