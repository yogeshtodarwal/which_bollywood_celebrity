The analysis of conformer distribution for ligands, when interacting with their high-affinity binding sites and comparing their distribution in water, demonstrated unique patterns. Specifically, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN at site S1 of tau, were primarily found in TT (75\%) and TTT (96\%) conformers, respectively (see Figure~\ref{fig: Ligand dihedral distribution}). In contrast, in a water environment, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN were present only at 18\% and 19\%, respectively, in these conformations.  As mentioned earlier, this structural alignment allows the carboxyl groups in pFTAA and qFTAA-CN to form strong Coulombic interactions with LYS369. For HS-276 and bTVBT4 at site S2, they favored Tt and T conformers, respectively. Intriguingly, the protein environment induced significant alterations in the conformer patterns of all four ligands when compared to their behavior in water. Furthermore, this shift in conformers is primarily influenced by the dihedral type SCCS, which displayed a strong preference for the trans position in all ligands within the tau environment. These observations imply that ligand binding can trigger structural changes that impact the conformer distribution, which may, in turn, potentially alter the photophysical properties of the ligands.



-------------------

Complementing these binding site observations,  the interaction energies given in Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies} show that the binding of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN to the tau fibril is driven by Coulomb interactions, while the binding of HS-276 and bTVBT4 is driven by LJ interactions. 



All ligands bind to their respective sites parallel to the A$\beta$(1––42) fibril axis. The binding sites S1 and S3 have been previously reported in the literature for other ligands.\cite{Murugan2018Jul} However, we did not find any mention of site S2 in the existing literature, where the HS-276 ligand binds. 


 Their binding to the A$\beta$(1––42) protein is driven by Coulombic interactions, as seen in Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies}.

 The binding of the neutral ligand HS-276 and cationic bTVBT4 to the A$\beta$(1––42) protein is mainly driven by LJ interactions (see Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies}).
