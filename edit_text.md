The free energy profiles of the ligands with A$\beta$(1––42) are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:PMFs}(a). Both anionic ligands exhibit similar profiles and begin to interact with the fibril when they are within 2 nm of the binding site region. At approximately 0.5 nm from this region, there is an intermediate state where only one carboxyl group side of the ligand interacts with LYS16.



 For HS-276, the PMF profile indicates that it starts to strongly interact with its binding site from approximately 1.0 nm distance, while bTVBT4 starts interacting with its binding site at about 1.5 nm from its position. The results also reveal that pFTAA has the highest binding energy (11.5 kcal/mol), followed by qFTAA-CN (10.8 kcal/mol) and HS-276 (10.5 kcal/mol). On the other hand, bTVBT4 displays the lowest binding energy (7.94 kcal/mol). These findings are consistent with previous experimental studies demonstrating the potential of pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, and HS-276 as reliable amyloid-binding probes and confirming their binding to A$\beta$(1––42) fibrils. The low binding energy of bTVBT4 aligns with experimental observations that this ligand does not exhibit fluorescence, suggesting it may not bind to A$\beta$(1––42) fibrils and might not be suitable for diagnosis compared to the other three ligands. Interestingly, BTA-3, a neutral ligand based on the benzothiazole moiety combined with two cyanide groups, has been reported to bind strongly at the surface site S1 of  A$\beta$(1––42).\cite{ArulMurugan2018Aug} In contrast, bTVBT4, which also contains a benzothiazole moiety, shows decreased affinity. This suggests that its combination with bi-thiophene reduces binding to A$\beta$(1––42). Moreover, BTV-3 and qFTAA-CN possess cyanide groups, which might be helping them bind strongly at the same site S1.




-------------------

All ligands bind to their respective sites parallel to the A$\beta$(1––42) fibril axis. The binding sites S1 and S3 have been previously reported in the literature for other ligands.\cite{Murugan2018Jul} However, we did not find any mention of site S2 in the existing literature, where the HS-276 ligand binds. 


 Their binding to the A$\beta$(1––42) protein is driven by Coulombic interactions, as seen in Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies}.

 The binding of the neutral ligand HS-276 and cationic bTVBT4 to the A$\beta$(1––42) protein is mainly driven by LJ interactions (see Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies}).
