Analyzing conformer distributions of ligands at their highly populated binding sites of tau and comparing these with distributions in water environment uncovers significant changes in conformer patterns.

Specifically, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN at site S1 of tau predominantly adopted TT (75\%) and TTT (96\%) conformers, respectively (see Figure~\ref{fig: Ligand dihedral distribution}).

The structural alignment of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN positions all carboxyl groups on one side, facilitating strong Coulombic interactions with LYS369.

As mentioned earlier, the structural alignment of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN allows all carboxyl groups to align on the same side, enabling strong Coulombic interactions with LYS369. In a water environment, however, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN were present in TT and TTT conformations at only 18% and 19%, respectively. For HS-276 and bTVBT4 at site S2, they favored Tt and T conformers, respectively. Intriguingly, the protein environment induced significant alterations in the conformer patterns of all four ligands when compared to their behavior in water. Furthermore, this shift in conformers is primarily influenced by the dihedral type SCCS, which displayed a strong preference for the trans position in all ligands within the tau environment. These observations imply that ligand binding can trigger structural changes that impact the conformer distribution, which may, in turn, potentially alter the photophysical properties of the ligands.



-------------------

Complementing these binding site observations,  the interaction energies given in Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies} show that the binding of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN to the tau fibril is driven by Coulomb interactions, while the binding of HS-276 and bTVBT4 is driven by LJ interactions. 



All ligands bind to their respective sites parallel to the A$\beta$(1––42) fibril axis. The binding sites S1 and S3 have been previously reported in the literature for other ligands.\cite{Murugan2018Jul} However, we did not find any mention of site S2 in the existing literature, where the HS-276 ligand binds. 


 Their binding to the A$\beta$(1––42) protein is driven by Coulombic interactions, as seen in Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies}.

 The binding of the neutral ligand HS-276 and cationic bTVBT4 to the A$\beta$(1––42) protein is mainly driven by LJ interactions (see Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies}).
