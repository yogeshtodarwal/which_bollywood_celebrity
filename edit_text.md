Motivation for Application

I am enthusiastic about applying for the postdoctoral position within the Wallenberg (DDLS-WASP) project on Machine-Learning and multiscale simulations of membrane protein functions at Stockholm University. This opportunity superbly aligns with my academic background and my keen interest in the application of theoretical models and computational techniques to chemical systems, particularly in understanding energy transduction in biological complexes.

My doctoral research under Prof. Patrick Norman at KTH Royal Institute of Technology honed my skills in computational prediction of protein-ligand interactions, focusing on neurodegenerative diseases. This experience directly prepares me to contribute to the project's aims of developing machine-learning methods to predict the biological reactivity and functional dynamics of membrane proteins, such as Complex I, critical for energy metabolism in mitochondria.

During my 5-year integrated master's at IIT Bombay, I developed a strong foundation in machine learning (ML), particularly Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs). I further applied these techniques during a summer internship at Radboud University and as a research assistant at IIT Bombay, where I used ML models to relate molecular data to their properties. These skills will be invaluable in achieving the project goals of integrating computational, biochemical, and biophysical data to understand protein function evolution and the impacts of disease-related mutations.

The prospect of working in Prof. Ville Kaila’s lab and collaborating with Dr. Simon Olsson’s team at Chalmers excites me. I am eager to leverage my expertise in computational biochemistry and machine learning to contribute to groundbreaking research on energy metabolism in cells. I believe that my background and skills make me an excellent candidate for this position, and I am keen to contribute to and learn from this innovative project.
