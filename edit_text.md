In previous studies, unbiased MD simulations were used to identify the binding sites of anionic pentameric oligothiophene (pFTAA) and bi-thiophene-benzothiazole (bTVBT4) when interacting with A$\beta$(1––42) and tau fibrils, respectively. In this work, we utilize a similar MD methodology to characterize the interactions between these ligands and amyloid fibrils, and compare the binding properties of four ligands (pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, HS-276, and bTVBT4) to amyloid fibrils (A$\beta$(1––42) and tau). 






Unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to identify the binding sites and characterize the interactions between these ligands and tau. the structured cores of Aβ(1–42) and tau fibrils.
