One promising approach for detecting these pathological lesions involves the use of fluorescent ligands, which are molecules capable of binding to AD-related lesions and emitting detectable light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These ligands can be further converted into positron emission tomography (PET) tracers by labeling one of the atoms within the ligand, thereby enabling real-time monitoring of AD pathogenesis.\cite{Nordeman2016} The selection of appropriate fluorescent ligands is critical, as they must possess specific characteristics to effectively detect AD-related lesions.\cite{Nunez-Diaz2024Jan} First and foremost, these ligands should have the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to ensure they can reach the target areas within the brain. Additionally, they should exhibit environmental sensitivity, meaning their optophysical properties change in response to different environments. These spectral changes can be attributed to both molecular and electronic structural alterations. 

To elucidate the molecular structural changes that underlie the desired environmental sensitivity and spectral shifts, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role. By simulating the interactions between ligands and amyloid fibrils in different environments, such as water or within proteins, and calculating the dihedral distributions of important rotatable bonds, insights into the structural changes in varying environments can be gained. Furthermore, MD simulations can uncover the binding modes of ligands to proteins and the energy landscapes of these complexes. This understanding is essential for the rational design of optical ligands.

Furthermore, MD simulations can uncover the binding modes of ligands to proteins and the energy landscapes of these complexes. Comparative studies among multiple ligands can provide insights into the factors driving fibril binding, enabling the design of ligands that selectively bind to chosen sites while avoiding others. For instance, a new generation of ligands could be designed to evade the binding sites of the FDA-approved [18F]AV-1451, which has been shown to produce misleading signals due to off-target binding.\cite{Vermeiren2018} Elucidating specific binding sites is advantageous, as it facilitates the development of ligands tailored to target desired regions while avoiding unintended interactions. This understanding is essential for the rational design of optical ligands.







The elucidation of specific binding sites on amyloid fibrils is also crucially important, as it allows for the rational design of ligands that can selectively target desired regions while avoiding off-target interactions. Comparative studies among multiple ligand candidates further enable the identification of key molecular determinants that govern fibril binding affinity and selectivity, guiding the optimization of ligand structures for improved performance.
