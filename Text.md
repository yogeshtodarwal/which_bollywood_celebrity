As a result of the observed conformer distribution patterns, the binding energies of the ligands provide further insight into the relationship between their structural preferences and interaction with protein binding sites. It has been found that pFTAA exhibits the highest binding energy of 29.7 kcal/mol at site S1, followed closely by qFTAA-CN with a binding energy of 21.7 kcal/mol at the same site. At site S2, bTVBT4 shows a binding energy of 7.9 kcal/mol, while HS-276 has a slightly lower binding energy of 7.1 kcal/mol. Notably, the binding PMF profiles of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN are remarkably similar, suggesting a barrierless binding process to site S1, with interactions commencing from a considerable distance. In contrast, bTVBT4 and HS-276 exhibit comparable binding profiles, and although a barrierless path is available, their interaction with site S2 only commences from a shorter distance.

Experimental results are aligned with  the calculated relative binding energies of the ligands, with pFTAA and bTVBT4 displaying fluorescence upon binding to tau fibrils, whereas HS-276 does not. The difference in binding energy between bTVBT4 (which fluoresces) and HS-276 (which does not) is only 0.8 kcal/mol, which falls within the error range of the PMF method used to calculate free energy. The ambiguous fluorescence behavior of qFTAA-CN observed in some experiments might be attributed to post-translational modifications of tau.\cite{Alquezar2021Jan} Specifically, the acetylation of LYS369 at site S3 could weaken its binding to tau and inhibit fluorescence. Further investigation is required to confirm this hypothesis and to explore whether pFTAA can bind to site S3 even after post-translational modifications, especially given its higher binding energy compared to qFTAA-CN.

In the analysis of ligand distribution surrounding the tau protofilament, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Density plot}(b), a distinct pattern is observed. Unlike the A$\beta$(1––42) case, here, HS-276 is characterized by a lower population density around the tau protofilament. On the other hand, pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, and bTVBT4 exhibit a comparatively high density around the tau protofilament. This difference in density likely be traced back to the differential affinity of HS-276 towards the tau fibrils.
