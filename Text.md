Results and Discussion

This section presents a comparative analysis of the binding properties of four ligands (pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, HS-276, and bTVBT4) to amyloid fibrils (Aβ(1–42) and tau). Unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to identify the binding sites and characterize the interactions between these ligands and the structured cores of Aβ(1–42) and tau fibrils. The structured cores were chosen as potential targets since the disordered peptides attached to these cores are expected to dissociate [1,2]. The cryo-EM structure-based Aβ(1–42) and tau fibril models from previous studies [3,4] were used as the starting point for the simulations.

The high ligand concentration used in the simulations facilitated a rapid exploration of the protein–ligand energy landscape. However, for the spatial distribution analysis, only ligand molecules that bound to the fibrils as single units were considered. This analysis enabled a comprehensive characterization of the density of each ligand around the protein, pinpointing the specific binding sites. By leveraging this visualization technique, valuable insights were gained into the protein–ligand interactions, and key residues contributing to the formation of stable complexes were identified for further analysis.

Comparative Analysis of Ligand Interactions with Aβ(1–42) Fibril

The spatial distribution analysis revealed distinct binding sites for each ligand type (anionic, cationic, or neutral) on the Aβ(1–42) fibril (Figure 1a). Interestingly, the anionic ligands pFTAA and qFTAA-CN shared the strongest binding site (S1) located around the positively charged LYS16 residue, as well as VAL18 and PHE20. The presence of the positively charged LYS16 likely facilitated the formation of stable interactions with the negatively charged anionic ligands through Coulombic attractions.

The neutral ligand HS-276 bound to two sites on the Aβ(1–42) fibril. The strongest binding site (S2) involved residues ASP7, SER8, GLY9, and TYR10, forming a pocket where HS-276 appeared to fit perfectly. The secondary binding site for HS-276 was near PHE20 and ALA21, overlapping with the binding site for anionic ligands. The cationic ligand bTVBT4 exhibited a distinct binding site (S3) comprising residues TYR10, GLU11, and VAL12, located near site S2. At site S3, bTVBT4 interacted strongly with TYR10 due to both Coulombic and Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions, while the interaction with the negatively charged GLU11 was weak due to the orientation of the partial negative charges away from the ligand. Since bTVBT4 primarily interacted with TYR10, it showcased relatively weak binding.

The binding sites S1 and S3 have been previously reported in the literature for other ligands [5]. However, site S2, where HS-276 binds, has not been reported previously. All ligands bound to their respective sites parallel to the Aβ(1–42) fibril axis.

The conformational preferences of ligands within the Aβ(1–42) environment and aqueous solution exhibited substantial differences, which can be attributed to varying electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, among other factors (Figure 3). For instance, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN predominantly adopted TT (94%) and TTT (70%) conformations, respectively, when bound to proteins. In contrast, they populated multiple conformations in water (Figure 3). The binding of these anionic ligands to the Aβ(1–42) protein was driven by Coulombic interactions (Table 1). When pFTAA or qFTAA-CN adopted their respective TT and TTT conformations, their carboxyl groups aligned in the same direction, facilitating stable protein–ligand complex formation through strong Coulombic interactions with the positively charged LYS16 residues at site S1. This directional alignment of carboxyl groups was critical for the binding of these anionic ligands.

In contrast, HS-276 demonstrated more dynamic behavior in both environments by populating multiple conformations, with a slightly higher population of the Tt (44%) conformation. Notably, bTVBT4 displayed a significant increase in the C (79%) conformation population within the Aβ(1–42) environment. The binding of the neutral ligand HS-276 and cationic bTVBT4 to the Aβ(1–42) protein was mainly driven by LJ interactions (Table 1). HS-276 bound to site S2 and involved significant interactions with the TYR10 and GLY9 residues. For bTVBT4, its binding to site S3 of the Aβ(1–42) protein fibril primarily involved TYR10 through π-π stacking. However, long simulations of the smaller bTVBT4–Aβ(1–42) model system indicated that this binding was not strong and eventually dissociated from the site, suggesting a relatively weaker affinity compared to the other ligands.

The binding energy profiles of the ligands with Aβ(1–42) are illustrated in Figure 2a. Both anionic ligands exhibited similar profiles and began to interact with the fibril when they were within 2 nm of the binding site region. At approximately 0.5 nm from this region, an intermediate state was observed where only one carboxyl group side of the ligand interacted with LYS16. For HS-276, the potential mean force (PMF) profile indicated that it started to strongly interact with its binding site from approximately 1.0 nm distance, while bTVBT4 started interacting with its binding site at about 1.5 nm from its position.

The results revealed that pFTAA had the highest binding energy (11.5 kcal/mol), followed by qFTAA-CN (10.8 kcal/mol) and HS-276 (10.5 kcal/mol). On the other hand, bTVBT4 displayed the lowest binding energy (7.94 kcal/mol). These findings are consistent with previous experimental studies demonstrating the potential of pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, and HS-276 as reliable amyloid-binding probes and confirming their binding to Aβ(1–42) fibrils [6,7]. The low binding energy of bTVBT4 aligns with experimental observations that this ligand does not exhibit fluorescence, suggesting it may not bind strongly to Aβ(1–42) fibrils and might not be suitable for diagnostic applications compared to the other three ligands.

Interestingly, BTA-3, a neutral ligand containing a benzothiazole moiety combined with two cyanide groups, has been reported to bind strongly at the surface site S1 of Aβ(1–42) [8]. In contrast, bTVBT4, which also contains a benzothiazole moiety, showed decreased affinity. This suggests that its combination with bi-thiophene reduces its binding to Aβ(1–42). Moreover, BTV-3 and qFTAA-CN possess cyanide groups, which might contribute to their strong binding at site S1.

The spatial distribution of ligands around the Aβ(1–42) protofilament (Figure 1a) showed significant differences in population density among the ligands. Specifically, pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, and HS-276 exhibited higher population densities compared to bTVBT4. This disparity in density can be primarily attributed to the relative affinities of these ligands toward Aβ(1–42), with bTVBT4 exhibiting a lower population density due to its reduced affinity.

Comparative Analysis of Ligand Interactions with Tau Fibril

The spatial distribution plots in Figure 1b illustrate the interactions between the ligands and the tau fibril, highlighting strong binding sites for pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, HS-276, and bTVBT4. Among these ligands, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN exhibited the strongest binding at site S1, where they primarily interacted with the amino acid residues ILE360, HIS362, PRO364, GLY367, and LYS369. Analogous to their binding with Aβ(1–42), these anionic ligands displayed a strong affinity for the positively charged LYS369 at this site. Additionally, they demonstrated weak interactions at two other sites, as shown in Figure 1b.

The positively charged ligand bTVBT4 and the neutral ligand HS-276 bound to site S2, interacting with the amino acid residues ILE360, THR361, and HIS362. However, bTVBT4 exhibited a stronger interaction with ILE360 and HIS362, while HS-276 primarily interacted with ILE360 and showed a weaker interaction with HIS362 due to reduced Coulombic interaction. Interestingly, there was one minor binding site common to all four ligands (Figure 1b), which has been reported in various experimental and theoretical studies, suggesting that it is easily accessible to most ligands [5,9,10].

The interaction energies given in Table 1 showed that the binding of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN to the tau fibril was driven by Coulomb interactions, while the binding of HS-276 and bTVBT4 was driven by LJ interactions.

The analysis of conformer distribution for ligands when interacting with their high-affinity binding sites and comparing their distribution in water demonstrated unique patterns (Figure 3). Specifically, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN at site S1 of tau were primarily found in TT (75%) and TTT (96%) conformers, respectively. In contrast, in a water environment, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN were present only at 18% and 19%, respectively, in these conformations. As mentioned earlier, this structural alignment allowed the carboxyl groups in pFTAA and qFTAA-CN to form strong Coulombic interactions with LYS369. For HS-276 and bTVBT4 at site S2, they favored Tt and T conformers, respectively.

Intriguingly, the protein environment induced significant alterations in the conformer patterns of all four ligands when compared to their behavior in water. Furthermore, this shift in conformers was primarily influenced by the dihedral type SCCS, which displayed a strong preference for the trans position in all ligands within the tau environment. These observations imply that ligand binding can trigger structural changes that impact the conformer distribution, which may, in turn, potentially alter the photophysical properties of the ligands.

The binding energies of the ligands provided further insight into the relationship between their structural preferences and interaction with protein binding sites. pFTAA exhibited the highest binding energy of 29.7 kcal/mol at site S1, followed closely by qFTAA-CN with a binding energy of 21.7 kcal/mol at the same site. At site S2, bTVBT4 showed a binding energy of 7.9 kcal/mol, while HS-276 had a slightly lower binding energy of 7.1 kcal/mol.

Notably, the binding PMF profiles of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN were remarkably similar (Figure 2b), suggesting a barrierless binding process to site S1, with interactions commencing from a considerable distance. In contrast, bTVBT4 and HS-276 exhibited comparable binding profiles, and although a barrierless path was available, their interaction with site S2 only commenced from a shorter distance.

Experimental results aligned with the calculated relative binding energies of the ligands, with pFTAA and bTVBT4 displaying fluorescence upon binding to tau fibrils, whereas HS-276 did not [11]. The difference in binding energy between bTVBT4 (which fluoresces) and HS-276 (which does not) was only 0.8 kcal/mol, falling within the error range of the PMF method used to calculate free energy. The ambiguous fluorescence behavior of qFTAA-CN observed in some experiments might be attributed to post-translational modifications of tau, specifically the acetylation of LYS369 at site S3, which could weaken its binding to tau and inhibit fluorescence [12]. Further investigation is required to confirm this hypothesis and to explore whether pFTAA can bind to site S3 even after post-translational modifications, especially given its higher binding energy compared to qFTAA-CN.

In the analysis of ligand distribution surrounding the tau protofilament (Figure 1b), a distinct pattern emerged. Unlike the Aβ(1–42) case, HS-276 was characterized by a lower population density around the tau protofilament, whereas pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, and bTVBT4 exhibited a comparatively high density. This difference in density likely stemmed from the differential affinity of HS-276 towards the tau fibrils.

Overall, this study provided valuable insights into the binding properties of four ligands (pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, HS-276, and bTVBT4) to amyloid fibrils (Aβ(1–42) and tau). The results highlighted the distinct binding sites and conformational preferences of these ligands, as well as their differential affinities toward the two fibril types. The findings were supported by experimental observations and aligned with previous literature, further validating the potential of these ligands as amyloid-binding probes for diagnostic applications.

While this study extensively explored the binding interactions and energetics, it is important to note some limitations. First, the high ligand concentration used in the simulations, although facilitating rapid exploration of the energy landscape, may not accurately represent physiological conditions. Additionally, the fibril models used were based on cryo-EM structures, which may not fully capture the dynamic nature of these assemblies. Future studies could incorporate more physiologically relevant ligand concentrations and explore the impact of fibril dynamics on the binding interactions.

Furthermore, the role of post-translational modifications, particularly on tau fibrils, warrants further investigation. As suggested, these modifications may influence the binding affinity and fluorescence behavior of certain ligands, potentially impacting their diagnostic utility. Incorporating these modifications in future simulations could provide valuable insights into their effects on ligand binding.

Moving forward, additional experimental validation of the computational findings would be beneficial, particularly for the newly identified binding site S2 for HS-276 on the Aβ(1–42) fibril. Such validation could further strengthen the understanding of the binding mechanisms and potentially unveil new avenues for the development of diagnostic probes or therapeutic interventions targeting amyloid fibrils.
