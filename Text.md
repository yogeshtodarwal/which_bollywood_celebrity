In previous studies, unbiased MD simulations were used to identify the binding sites of anionic pentameric oligothiophene (pFTAA) and bi-thiophene-benzothiazole (bTVBT4) when interacting with A$\beta$(1––42) and tau fibrils, respectively. In this article, we use a similar MD methodology to compare the binding properties of four ligands (pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, HS-276, and bTVBT4) to amyloid fibrils (A$\beta$(1––42) and tau). The structured cores of A$\beta$(1––42) and tau are potential targets for the ligands, as disordered peptides attached to these cores are expected to dissociate\cite{Zhang2010,fitzpatrick_cryo-em_2017}. Therefore, we adopted the cryo-EM structure-based A$\beta$(1––42) and tau fibrils from our previous studies as a starting point for MD simulation. The A$\beta$(1––42) and tau fibrils were simulated independently with an equal mixture of four ligands (i.e., 15 molecules of each ligands type). This artificially high concentration of the ligands was used to quickly explore the protein––ligand energy landscape. However, for the analysis of spatial distribution, only ligand molecules that bound to the fibrils as single units were considered. 

Through spatial distribution analysis, the density of various ligand types around the protein is comprehensively characterized, thereby pinpointing the specific binding sites.

The spatial distribution analysis comprehensively characterizes density of each ligand type around the protein, thereby pinpointing the specific binding sites.

A density plot analysis comprehensively characterizes the spatial distribution of ligands around the protein and pinpoints the specific binding sites for each ligand. By leveraging this visualization technique, we can gain valuable insights into the protein––ligand interactions and identify key residues that contribute to the formation of stable complexes for further analysis.

The following sections provide a detailed examination of ligands interaction with A$\beta$(1––42) and tau fibrils, as well as the behavior of these ligands in a water environment. Initially,  binding properties of ligands to the A$\beta$(1––42) fibril are analyzed and  a comparative analysis of their interactions is conducted. Subsequently, we will delve into a similar examination of ligand interactions with tau fibrils. In both sections, we also discuss possible unique aspects of ligand behavior in a water environment, differentiating it from their behavior within protein environments. Ultimately, we conclude by reflecting on the general binding patterns exhibited by these ligands.
