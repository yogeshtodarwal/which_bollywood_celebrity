The spatial distribution plots illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Density plot}(b) display the interactions between the ligands and tau fibril, highlighting strong binding sites for pFTAA, qFTAA-CN, HS-276, and bTVBT4. Among these ligands, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN exhibit the strongest binding at site S1, where they primarily interact with the amino acid residues ILE360, HIS362, PRO364, GLY367, and LYS369. At this site, analogous to their binding with A$\beta$(1––42), they display a strong affinity for the positively charged LYS369. These anionic ligands also demonstrate weak interactions at two other sites, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Density plot}(b). Both the positively charged ligand bTVBT4 and the neutral ligand HS-276 bind to site S2, where they interact with the amino acid residues ILE360, THR361, and HIS362. However, bTVBT4 exhibits a stronger interaction with ILE360 and HIS362, while HS-276 primarily interacts with ILE360 and shows weaker interaction with HIS362 due to a reduction in Coulombic interaction. Interestingly, there is one minor binding site common to all four ligands (see Figure \ref{fig:Density plot}(b)). This site has also been reported in various experimental and theoretical studies, suggesting that it is easily accessible to most ligands.\cite{Murugan2018Jul,Shi2021May,Murugan2021Jul}. Complementing these binding site observations,  the interaction energies given in Table \ref{tab:interaction_energies} show that the binding of pFTAA and qFTAA-CN to tau fibril is driven by Coulomb interactions, while the binding of HS-276 and bTVBT4 is driven by LJ interactions. 

The analysis of conformer distribution for ligands, when interacting with their high-affinity binding sites and comparing their distribution in water, demonstrated unique patterns. Specifically, for pFTAA and qFTAA-CN at site S1 of tau, they were primarily found in TT (with 75\%) and TTT (with 96\%) conformers, respectively (see Figure \ref{fig: Ligand dihedral distribution}). In contrast, in a water environment, pFTAA and qFTAA-CN were present only at 18\% and 19\%, respectively. As mentioned earlier, this structural alignment allows the carboxyl groups in pFTAA and qFTAA-CN to form strong Coulombic interactions with LYS369. For HS-276 and bTVBT4 at site S2, they favored Tt and T conformers, respectively. Intriguingly, the protein environment induced significant alterations in the conformer patterns of all four ligands when compared to their behavior in water. Furthermore, this shift in conformers is primarily influenced by the dihedral type, SCCS, which displayed a strong preference for the trans position in all ligands within the tau environment. These observations imply that ligand binding can trigger structural changes that impact the conformer distribution, which may, in turn, possibly alter the photophysical properties of the ligands.
