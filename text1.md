To elucidate the molecular structural changes that underlie the desired environmental sensitivity and spectral shifts, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role. By simulating the interactions between ligands and amyloid fibrils in different environments, such as water or within proteins, and calculating the dihedral distributions of important rotatable bonds, insights into the structural changes in varying environments can be gained. Furthermore, MD simulations can uncover the binding modes of ligands to protein fibrils and the energy landscapes of these complexes. Comparative studies among multiple ligands can provide insights into the factors driving fibril binding, enabling the design of ligands that selectively bind to chosen sites while avoiding others. Elucidating specific binding sites is advantageous, as it facilitates the development of ligands tailored to target desired regions while avoiding unintended interactions. For instance, a new generation of ligands could be designed to avoid the binding sites of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved [18F]AV-1451, which has been shown to produce misleading signals due to off-target binding.

Building on the foundation laid by the comprehensive analysis provided by MD simulations, the exploration of specific molecular structures becomes paramount in the quest to tailor ligand interactions for enhanced specificity and efficacy. In this context, ligands based on the thiophene moiety emerge as promising candidates. The molecular structures of these ligands, presented in Figure \ref{fig:ligands}, embody a strategic combination of the thiophene unit with other structural motifs to achieve targeted binding to amyloid fibrils. This targeted approach is illustrated through the investigation of four specific ligands: the bTVBT4, which integrates a bi-thiophene unit with benzothiazole for exclusive binding to tau aggregates; the HS-276, combining bi-thiophene with an azaindole moiety to preferentially target A$\beta$(1––42) aggregates; the pFTAA, a luminescent conjugated poly-thiophene (LCP) that binds to both hallmark tau and A$\beta$(1––42) folds of Alzheimer's Disease (AD); and the qFTAA-CN, another LCP with a specific affinity for A$\beta$(1––42), though its interaction with tau aggregates remains to be fully elucidated. Despite the shared thiophene base, these ligands exhibit a wide array of binding functionalities towards amyloids, demonstrating the critical role of structural modifications in defining ligand specificity and action. This selection of thiophene-based ligands represents a focused attempt to harness the insights gained from MD simulations, enabling a nuanced understanding of ligand-amyloid interactions that drives the development of highly selective therapeutic agents.
